This means that Northwind Standard will\\npay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays.\\n\\nThe primary and secondary rules that apply to Northwind Standard are important to\\nunderstand. When you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and\\nthe secondary plan pays second. The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying\\nthe largest portion of your healthcare costs.\\n\\nFor example, if you have a spouse's health plan and Northwind Standard, your spouse's plan\\nwould be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan. This\\nmeans that your spouse's plan would pay for the majority of your healthcare costs and\\nNorthwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs.\\n\\nIt's important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not\\ncovered by the primary plan. Additionally, Northwind Standard will not pay any expenses\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\nthat exceed the limits of the primary plan. For example, if the primary plan has a $1,000\\ndeductible and Northwind Standard has a $500 deductible, only the $500 deductible from\\nthe primary plan will be paid.\\n\\nThere are some exceptions to the primary and secondary rules. For instance, if you have\\nMedicare coverage, it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and Northwind\\nStandard will be the secondary coverage. However, if you have Medicare Part D for\\nprescription drugs, Northwind Standard will be the primary coverage and Medicare Part D\\nwill be the secondary coverage.\\n\\nIt's also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage, you may need to\\n\\n**Question:** How much is deductible?\\nFinal Response:\"\n",
