This includes avoiding activities\\nthat can exacerbate the problem, such as grinding teeth or chewing gum, and practicing\\nrelaxation techniques to reduce stress. Additionally, employees should practice good\\nposture and avoid sleeping on their stomach to reduce strain on the jaw. Practicing good\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\noral hygiene is also important, as TMJ can be caused by dental problems such as\\nmisalignment of the teeth.\\n\\nFinally, employees should be aware that TMJ is a chronic condition, which means that it may\\nrequire ongoing management. Regular visits to the healthcare provider for diagnosis and\\ntreatment may be necessary in order to manage the condition. Employees should also be\\naware that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover all TMJ treatments, so it is\\nimportant to understand their financial responsibility for any treatment that is not covered.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Northwind Standard plan does provide coverage for TMJ care, but there\\nmay be certain treatments and services that are not covered. It is important for employees\\nto understand their financial responsibility prior to receiving treatment, and to discuss their\\ncondition and treatment options with their healthcare provider. Additionally, it is important\\nfor employees to practice good posture, avoid activities that can exacerbate the problem,\\nand practice good oral hygiene in order to manage their TMJ condition.\\n\\n\\n### Therapeutic Injections Therapeutic Injections\\n\\nTherapeutic injections are a covered service under the Northwind Standard plan.
